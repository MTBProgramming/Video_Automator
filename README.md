# Video_Automator
Python/Unix script that edits videos for me

A wise programmer had taught me “once you find yourself doing the same thing 3 times, it’s time to automate”, and so I began the search for my next project. After analyzing all of my daily tasks, I realized that I spent around an hour behind my computer screen every day downloading, editing, and uploading myself practicing the piano for YouTube. In order to get my hour-a-day back, I began work on a video editor that would use Android Debug Bridge and Unix commands to download latest video larger than six gigabytes from my phone, control my laptop’s screen using Python’s ‘Pyautogui’ library to edit the video in Adobe Premiere Pro, and finally, use my Google Cloud account to upload the video to my YouTube channel. After about two-and-a-half weeks of programming and trouble-shooting, I successfully coded a button that when pressed, does all of the editing for me, giving me my hour back, as time is precious to me and this one hour I regained will add up over time.
